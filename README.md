## How to Run

This is a backend + frontend project using Node.js and MongoDB.  
You can run it locally by starting the server (`app.js`) and opening `index.html` in a browser.

> Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine.

## How It Works

1. User submits a long URL through the form.
2. The backend generates and stores a short code using `nanoid` + MongoDB.
3. Visiting the short link redirects the user to the original URL.
